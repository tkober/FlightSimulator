# Physical Home Cockpit for Microsoft Flight Simulator X. #

Used technology:

* Arduino for controls and panels (switches, handles, displays)
* iOS for complex UI like like the PFD (primary flight display, artificial horizon)
* AngularJS and Meteor for a web app, which will be used as an electronic  flight back (contains data related to the flight like maps, routes, frequencies...)
